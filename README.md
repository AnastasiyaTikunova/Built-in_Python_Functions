# Built-in Python Functions: Custom Implementations & Testing

ðŸŽ¯ **Project Goal**  
To deeply understand the syntax and mechanics of Pythonâ€™s built-in functions by implementing them manually and testing their behavior.

ðŸ›  **Repository Contents**  
- `implementation_built_in_python_functions.py` â€“ Custom implementations of popular built-in functions like `map`, `filter`, `enumerate`, `zip`, and others, with detailed docstrings explaining signatures and internal behavior.  
- `testing_implementations.py` â€“ A testing module that verifies the correctness of custom functions and compares them to the native Python versions.

ðŸ“š **What I Learned**  
- How built-in functions work at a deeper level  
- Iterators, generators, and higher-order functions  
- Writing tests and code documentation  
- Navigating and interpreting official Python documentation  

ðŸ§  **Useful For**  
- Beginners learning Python fundamentals  
- Developers seeking to demystify Pythonâ€™s internal tools  
- Interview prep and strengthening Python hard skills  

ðŸ“‚ **How to Use**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Built-in_Python_Functions.git
cd Built-in_Python_Functions

# Run the main module
python implementation_built_in_python_functions.py

# Run the tests
python testing_implementations.py
```
